# PPDRIVE

**PPDRIVE** is a powerful, standalone file manager written in Rust, designed for seamless integration into other applications via a RESTful API. Whether you're building a complex backend system or need a standalone file server with authentication and file-level permissions, PPDRIVE provides a robust, secure, and extensible solution.

## Installation
#### Linux and MacOS
**Prequisite**: Please make sure you have created a database for PPDRIVE to save records. You'll need to add the database URL after installation, during configuration. We support Postgres, MySQL and SQLite databases.

Once your database is ready, kindly proceed to the following steps:

- Install:
```bash
curl -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prodbyola/ppdrive/refs/heads/main/install.sh | sh
```

- Configure:
```bash
ppdrive configure
```

- Start
```bash
systemctl --user start ppdrive
```

#### Docker Compose
If you have docker compose, you can use our [compose template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prodbyola/ppdrive/refs/heads/main/compose.yml) for full installation (database included). Copy and modify the [compose template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prodbyola/ppdrive/refs/heads/main/compose.yml) to suit your need. Take note to update `ppdrive_db` service environments and `PPDRIVE_DATABASE_URL` in `ppdrive` service.

- Build: Build docker containers
```sh
docker-compose up --build -d
```

- Configure: Open `ppdrive` container terminal and run the configuration command.
```sh
docker-compose exec ppdrive sh

ppdrive --configure
```

- Restart: Now restart the containers
```sh
docker-compose restart
```
