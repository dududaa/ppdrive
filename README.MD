# PPDRIVE (IN DEVELOPMENT)

**PPDRIVE** is a free, open-source cloud storage service built with Rust for speed, security, and reliability. It provides a powerful set of RESTful APIs (support other protocols coming soon) that let you manage both remote and local files through secure, lightning-fast operations.

Whether you're building your own version of Google Drive, OneDrive, or Dropbox, PPDRIVE gives you robust, secure, and extensible APIs that allow users to interact seamlessly with your server‚Äôs file system at the application level.

Need an alternative to AWS S3? PPDRIVE integrates effortlessly into your existing applications. From self-hosted media streaming platforms to enterprise-grade storage solutions, PPDRIVE helps you build faster, stay in control, and pay nothing.

## Motivation
We notice that many startups, organizations, and developers prefer not to rely on third-party cloud storage services due to concerns about long-term costs, data privacy, and vendor lock-in. Unfortunately, the lack of viable alternatives often leaves them with limited choices. PPDRIVE was created to address this gap ‚Äî offering a flexible, self-hosted suite of APIs for remote file management and storage.

## Why PPDRIVE?
- **Privacy and Data Control**: All your user, application and business data stay on your server. PPDRIVE does not send, spy or use your data in any way.
- **No vendor lock-in. No hidden charges**: Unlike AWS, GCP and other commercial alternatives, you don't need to pay for anything.
- **Complete Ownership**: We don't collect any "insight" or gain access to any of your data.
- **Ease of Use**: Flexible service management tools for installing plugins, viewing or cancelling running services.
- **Security**: Secure by default.
- **Transparency**: The codebase is right here! Have a look at it, modify it and help us shape the future.
- **Speed**: Very fast operation handlers.
- **Lightweight**: We aim to make PPDRIVE as lightweight as possible. The starting point is to make sure you can install only what you need.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚öôÔ∏è **REST API Interface**: Interact with the file system programmatically from any external application.
- üîê **Flexible Authentication**: PPDRIVE is secure by default, providing JWT authentication to protect private resources according to your applications. If you prefer to use PPDRIVE as a free tool and don't need protected access, you can opt-in for "No Auth" feature.
- ü™£ **Buckets**: Create isolated and configurable file buckets for better file system organization.
- üß© **Pluggable Integration**: Easily integrate into existing backends or operate as a standalone executable.
- üì¶ **Prebuilt Executables**: Install and run with no setup required.
- üßæ **File & Directory Operations**: Upload, download, rename, delete, and move files or folders.
- üîí **Secure by Default**: Runs with secure configurations and minimal surface area.
- üõ¢ **Cross Database Support**: Support for Postgres, MySQL and SQLite (default) database backends.
