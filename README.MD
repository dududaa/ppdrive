# PPDRIVE (IN DEVELOPMENT)

**PPDRIVE** is a free and open-source cloud storage service written in Rust. PPDRIVE service provides a set of RESTful APIs that allows you to manage your remote and local files via secure and blazing fast operations.

If you're building your own version of Google Drive, Microsoft's OneDrive or even Dropbox, PPDRIVE provides a robust, secure, and extensible solution. You can also integrate PPDRIVE into your own applications as an alternative to AWS S3. Building self-hosted media streaming platforms? Build faster using PPDRIVE at zero cost.

## Why PPDRIVE?
- **Privacy and Data Control**: All your data on your server.
- **Full Ownership**: We don't have access to any of your data.
- **Ease of User**: Flexible service management tools.
- **Security**: Secure by default.
- **Transparency**: The codebase is right here! Have a look at it, modify it and help us shape the future.
- **Speed**: Fast operation handlers.
- **Lightweight**: We aim to make PPDRIVE lightweight. The starting point is to make sure you can install only what you need.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚öôÔ∏è **REST API Interface**: Interact with the file system programmatically from any external application.
- üîê **Flexible Authentication**: PPDRIVE is secure by default, providing JWT authentication to protect private resources according to your applications. If you prefer to use PPDRIVE as a free tool and don't need protected access, you can opt-in for "No Auth" feature.
- ü™£ **Buckets**: Create isolated and configurable file buckets for better file system organization.
- üß© **Pluggable Integration**: Easily integrate into existing backends or operate as a standalone executable.
- üì¶ **Prebuilt Executables**: Install and run with no setup required.
- üßæ **File & Directory Operations**: Upload, download, rename, delete, and move files or folders.
- üîí **Secure by Default**: Runs with secure configurations and minimal surface area.
- üõ¢ **Cross Database Support**: Support for Postgres, MySQL and SQLite (default) database backends.

#### Roadmap Features (Let's Build Together)
- Admin UI: Administrative client for managing your drive visually.
- File Compression: Compress files on the fly or at any convenient time.
- File Conversion: Convert files from one format to another.
- Image manipulation: Provide url queries for manipulating images.
- Async Upload: Upload large files in the background.
- File Streaming: Enable file streaming (for video/audio streaming platforms and other use cases)
- ~~Buckets: Buckets implementation for clients.~~
- Mime Limits: Limit uploads to specified mime types.

## Installation
#### Linux and MacOS
**Prequisite**: Please make sure you have created a database for PPDRIVE to save records. You'll need to add the database URL after installation, during configuration. We support Postgres, MySQL and SQLite databases.

Once your database is ready, kindly proceed to the following steps:

- Install:
```bash
curl -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prodbyola/ppdrive/refs/heads/main/install.sh | sh
```

- Configure:
```bash
ppdrive configure
```

- Start
```bash
systemctl --user start ppdrive
```

#### Docker Compose
If you have docker compose, you can use our [compose template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prodbyola/ppdrive/refs/heads/main/compose.yml) for full installation (database included). Copy and modify the [compose template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prodbyola/ppdrive/refs/heads/main/compose.yml) to suit your need. Take note to update `ppdrive_db` service environments and `PPDRIVE_DATABASE_URL` in `ppdrive` service.

- Build: Build docker containers
```sh
docker-compose up --build -d
```

- Configure: Open `ppdrive` container terminal and run the configuration command.
```sh
docker-compose exec ppdrive sh

ppdrive --configure
```

- Restart: Now restart the containers
```sh
docker-compose restart
```
